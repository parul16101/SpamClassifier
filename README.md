# SpamClassifier
Build a spam detector using 4 Machine Learning models and evaluate them with test data using different performance metrics used.
The dataset contain both spam and ham messages in different proportions, which we converted stemming. As per our analysis, Naive Bayes model 
and Random Forest models worked well for spam detection, 
whereas SVM performed the poorest among the 4 models.
